Role: You are a world-class Generative AI Engineer building HIPAA-compliant, enterprise-grade healthcare automation within the iSynera Healthcare Platform.

Goal: Add six advanced Generative AI-powered modules to the iSynera platform that significantly reduce clinician workload, increase referral response speed, and automate high-volume operational processes. All modules must integrate with existing EHR/EMR data and respect data privacy and access control policies.

🧠 Core Features to Build with Generative AI:
🔁 1. AI-Driven Referral Acceleration Engine
Goal: Automate the extraction and population of key patient and referral data from documents (eFAX, HL7 Direct messages).

Use LLM-based document parsing to extract patient demographics, diagnosis, insurance info, care history.

Parse PDFs, TIFFs, HL7 CDA, and FHIR messages.

Populate EHR fields using FHIR APIs or HL7 v2 interfaces.

Flag incomplete records with suggested autofill options.

Enable response auto-drafting with pre-validated data.

AI Enhancements:

Named Entity Recognition (NER) for key fields.

Document classification (e.g., referral vs. assessment).

Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to flag ambiguous data entries.

🗣️ 2. Ambient Listening + Smart Transcription Module ("iSynera Scribe")
Goal: Enable real-time voice-to-text transcription for patient assessments and auto-populate EHR fields.

Integrate Whisper or a similar open-source STT model.

Use GPT-4 or fine-tuned LLM to convert transcript into structured summaries.

Match output to SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format.

Highlight confidence scores for clinician approval.

AI Enhancements:

Use fine-tuned LLM for healthcare summarization.

Smart auto-suggestion for CPT/ICD code hints from audio.

Allow voice commands like “Mark vitals abnormal” or “Flag this for review”.

🧾 3. Referral Packet Summary Generator
Goal: Use Generative AI to extract and summarize key patient referral packet info for rapid triage.

Accept multi-page documents, handwritten notes, scanned images.

Convert into concise clinical overviews: symptoms, conditions, medications, risk level.

Generate clinician-facing summaries with embedded links to source snippets.

AI Enhancements:

Multi-document summarization and cross-referencing.

Clinical urgency prediction (e.g., triage level score).

Suggest next best action or required follow-up steps.

🧠 4. AI-Supported HOPE Clinical Decision Module
Goal: Assist hospice agencies in scoring and analyzing the HOPE assessment for care planning.

Ingest structured/unstructured assessment input.

AI returns suggested symptom impact ranking with medical reasoning.

Supports shared decision-making with rationale and explanations.

AI Enhancements:

Explainable AI (XAI) output for regulatory trust.

Automatically detect symptom trends or inconsistencies.

Integrate with future palliative care guidelines and CMS mandates.

📋 5. Generative Chart Review + AI Coding Assistant
Goal: Support coders and reviewers by pre-analyzing visit notes, progress reports, and assessments.

Extract relevant codes (ICD, CPT, HCPCS).

Highlight discrepancies in documentation.

Provide coding justification for reimbursement accuracy.

AI Enhancements:

Use LLM + rules engine hybrid model for compliance validation.

Detect missing or conflicting medical necessity documentation.

Offer "coding confidence score" and recommended flags.

⚙️ 6. Autonomous AI Agents for Routine Ops
Goal: Develop purpose-built autonomous agents to perform recurring operational tasks:

Agent A: Handles appointment scheduling and calendar conflicts.

Agent B: Auto-manages prior authorizations via payer APIs.

Agent C: Engages patients via SMS/email for reminders, intake, and feedback collection.

AI Enhancements:

Use LangChain/AutoGen-style orchestration to allow agents to collaborate.

Secure task queues for retry/failure handling.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agents pull knowledge from internal policy and SOP docs.

📦 Technical Specifications:
Language: Python 3.10+, TypeScript (for front-end module)

Frameworks: FastAPI, LangChain, Streamlit (for prototyping), Next.js (for UI)

Models: GPT-4, Whisper, PubMedBERT (or BioGPT), TrOCR (for scanned docs)

Data Pipelines: FHIR-compliant ETL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka (for real-time ops)

Security: Implement OAuth2.0, role-based access, audit logging, and PHI redaction.

Compliance: HIPAA, HITECH, SOC 2 Type II-ready architecture.

🧪 Bonus:
Include a unit test framework (e.g., Pytest), mock FHIR APIs, and synthetic PHI for development/testing. Wrap features as reusable microservices in Docker containers with Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment
