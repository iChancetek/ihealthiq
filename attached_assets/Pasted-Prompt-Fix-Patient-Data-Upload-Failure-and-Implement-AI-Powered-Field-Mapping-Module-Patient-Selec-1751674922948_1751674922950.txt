Prompt: Fix Patient Data Upload Failure and Implement AI-Powered Field Mapping
Module: Patient Selection & Data Management
Section: Select Patient → Upload Patient Data

❌ Current Issue
The Upload Patient Data feature is currently failing to function as expected. Specifically:

Uploaded files are not being parsed correctly.

No patient data fields are being populated in the form.

Users are unable to review or create new patient records from the uploaded data.

📥 Attached File Contains Required Fields
🔗 Please refer to the attached file — it contains the full list of fields that must be captured and mapped when creating a new patient record. These fields should serve as the data model for the upload process.

✅ Required Fixes and Enhancements
1. AI-Powered Field Extraction
Use AI/NLP to automatically extract all relevant data from uploaded files (CSV or PDF).

The system must intelligently map extracted values to their corresponding fields in the new patient form.

2. Field Coverage
Ensure all fields listed in the attached file are fully supported during extraction and mapping, including:

Patient demographics (Name, DOB, Gender, etc.)

Contact details

Insurance and provider information

Medical history, allergies, medications, referral details, etc.

3. Pre-Creation Review Interface
After data extraction:

Display a review screen with all pre-filled fields.

Allow the user to manually correct or complete missing data before submission.

Enable the “Create Patient” button only after review is complete.

🔁 Expected Workflow
User selects “Upload Patient Data”

Uploads a CSV or PDF document

AI extracts and auto-fills the patient form

Review screen displays all mapped fields

User reviews, edits, and confirms the data

User clicks “Create Patient” to save the record

🔒 Compliance & Integrity
Ensure the entire upload and data entry process complies with HIPAA standards.

Include:

Encrypted file uploads

Audit logging of AI extraction and user corrections

Role-based access controls
