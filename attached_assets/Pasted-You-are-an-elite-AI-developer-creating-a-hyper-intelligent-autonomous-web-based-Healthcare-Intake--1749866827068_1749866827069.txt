You are an elite AI developer creating a hyper-intelligent, autonomous web-based Healthcare Intake & Onboarding application inside Replit using OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude AI.

Your mission is to design a Generative AI system that performs the work of 10 highly-trained intake nurses in minutes—filling in all required fields, checking eligibility, scheduling, and preparing CMS-compliant documentation—all automatically.

🧰 Your Tech Stack
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS + React Router

Backend: Express.js + Node.js

Database: Firebase Firestore (via Admin SDK)

AI Layer: GPT-4 or Claude via Replit Secrets

Deployment: Replit Web Server with HTTPS

🎯 GOAL: Fully Autonomous, Super-Intelligent Intake Workflow
Build a Gen AI-driven system that:

Scans, interprets, and extracts referral data from any format (PDF, fax, email)

Fills all patient intake forms automatically

Validates data for accuracy, completeness, and CMS Conditions of Participation (CoP)

Runs eligibility verification and payer checks

Generates all documentation and digital consents

Assigns staff and schedules visits

Outputs a complete, audit-ready patient intake packet in < 15 minutes

✅ System Capabilities to Implement
🧾 1. Autonomous Referral Reader & Field Populator
OCR/NLP engine scans documents and EMR files

Gen AI intelligently:

Fills fields: Name, DOB, Diagnosis, Physician, Referral Date, Insurance, Contact Info

Writes medical summaries from unstructured notes

Flags and resolves missing or suspicious data

Writes explanations for flagged issues automatically

✅ 2. Real-Time Eligibility & Insurance Checker
API integration with clearinghouses (Availity, Waystar)

Gen AI:

Interprets eligibility reports

Fills insurance forms with plan details

Flags invalid/expired coverage

Generates next steps (e.g. "Request updated Medicaid card")

🏡 3. Homebound Screening & Documentation
Uses CMS criteria to determine homebound eligibility

Gen AI:

Auto-writes rationale for homebound status based on diagnosis, mobility, and support needs

Ensures required elements are present

Suggests additions to strengthen clinical justification

🧠 4. Smart Staff Scheduler
Match patients to available RN/PT by:

Location, license, time availability, and patient needs

Gen AI:

Optimizes schedule and suggests best-fit provider

Flags missed SOC windows and scheduling conflicts

Auto-adjusts and notifies admin/staff

🖋️ 5. Digital Consent & Compliance Packet Creator
Delivers HIPAA, patient rights, and consent forms digitally

Gen AI:

Auto-fills and explains each document

Captures e-signatures securely

Validates completeness

Bundles documents into a timestamped compliance packet with an audit trail

🔁 Super-Intelligent AI Loop
At every step, the AI engine:

Validates field entries

Auto-generates missing content

Flags risk areas with explanations

Writes out a full summary of what was done, what’s pending, and next best actions

🚀 Outcome
10x nurse productivity, achieved through automation

<15-minute full patient intake with minimal human input

Audit-ready, CMS-aligned, compliant, and intelligent at every step
