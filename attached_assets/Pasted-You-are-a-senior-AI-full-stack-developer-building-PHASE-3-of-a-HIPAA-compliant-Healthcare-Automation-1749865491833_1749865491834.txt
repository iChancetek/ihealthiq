You are a senior AI full-stack developer building PHASE 3 of a HIPAA-compliant Healthcare Automation Platform. Your objective is to develop a super-intelligent, Gen AI-powered Billing, Claims, and Denials Management system that improves cash flow and drastically reduces revenue loss due to claim rejections, denials, or submission delays.

Your AI system must automate, validate, and intelligently adapt to payer-specific billing behavior while offering real-time financial accuracy, insights, and recommendations.

🎯 CORE GOAL:
Increase reimbursement speed, reduce denials, and minimize human billing errors using Generative AI for intelligent automation, validation, and correction.

✅ Features & AI-Enhanced Capabilities:
1. AI Claim Generator
Pull structured data from:

Completed clinical visits

Plan of Care (POC) approvals

Authorization and referral records

Autogenerate:

CMS-1500 and UB-04 forms

ANSI 837 electronic claims

Seamlessly integrate with national clearinghouses (e.g., Availity, Office Ally).

Use Gen AI to verify field mapping logic, detect data anomalies, and validate billing sequence logic.

2. Pre-Submission Scrubbing Engine
Validate critical fields:

NPI, ICD-10 codes, CPT/HCPCS, service dates, signatures

Flag:

Missing documentation (e.g., unsigned notes)

Non-billable services (e.g., services without POC approval)

Use Gen AI to:

Cross-check internal EHR/EMR data consistency

Autocorrect errors and recommend remediation before submission

Learn and flag risky submissions based on historical rejection patterns

3. AI-Driven Billing Rules Engine
Supports dynamic payer rule logic:

State Medicaid MCO policies

Medicare Advantage plans

Private insurer-specific constraints

Gen AI continually learns from denials, updates rule sets dynamically, and auto-tunes submission logic to improve approval rates.

AI flags outdated rules and suggests new ones based on payer bulletin feeds and past adjudication trends.

4. Denial Management Bot
Import and parse:

Electronic Remittance Advices (ERA)

Explanation of Benefits (EOB)

AI identifies denial reason codes (CO, OA, PR, etc.)

Auto-categorize denial types:

Technical errors, eligibility, authorization, missing data

Suggest AI-generated remediation steps such as:

Reauthorization requests

Corrected claims

Draft appeal initiation

AI matches denial reasons with documentation and payer policies to guide best-next actions.

5. Auto Appeals Assistant
Autogenerate appeal letters using:

Cited CMS regulations

Plan-specific denial guidelines

Prior precedent responses

Personalize letters for the payer, referencing claim ID, patient, provider info, and reason for overturn.

Use Gen AI to ensure proper tone, formatting, and regulation citation for maximum overturn success.

🔐 Security & Compliance:
Ensure all data processing complies with HIPAA, HITECH, and CMS standards.

AI must maintain audit trails of all claim modifications and recommendations.

🧠 Super-Intelligence Requirements:
Gen AI must continuously learn from:

Past approvals and denials

Payer behavior shifts

Documentation gaps

Embed explainability: Allow admins to see why claims were flagged, denied, or fixed.

Provide real-time claim health scoring and “risk of denial” metrics before submission.
