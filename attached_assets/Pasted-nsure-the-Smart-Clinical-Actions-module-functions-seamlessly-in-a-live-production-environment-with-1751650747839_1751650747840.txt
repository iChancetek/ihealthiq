nsure the Smart Clinical Actions module functions seamlessly in a live, production environment, with full AI-driven automation, accurate data extraction, and intuitive clinical workflows stemming from SOAP notes.

✅ 1. Core Functional Requirements
🧠 AI-Powered Clinical Automation from SOAP Notes
Enable real-time extraction of structured data from AI-generated or manually edited SOAP notes.

Key actions include:

Extract Medications

Analyze Referrals

These actions should trigger appropriate downstream workflows in Orders, Referrals, and Refill modules.

⚠️ Critical Issues to Resolve
The following features are currently non-functional and must be corrected for production readiness:

Save & Continue: Button does not function; changes are not being retained.

Change Patient Option: Selecting or switching patients fails to update the clinical context.

Search Function: The search feature is unresponsive or inaccurate when querying patient data.

Clinical Documentation Access: Notes are not saving or appearing in the Clinical Documentation section.
→ All of the above must be resolved with proper session handling, data persistence, and user feedback indicators.

✏️ 2. SOAP Note Edit Capabilities
Post-transcription SOAP notes must support:

Manual text editing within a rich text editor or structured fields

Voice-based dictation for updates and corrections

All edits should sync back to the linked patient record and update downstream modules in real time.

⚙️ 3. Intelligent Clinical Automation
A. Orders & Refills
Enable auto-population of medication orders and refill entries directly from transcribed or dictated notes.

Fields to extract and populate include:

Medication Name

Dosage

Frequency

Duration

B. Referrals
Referrals should be automatically pre-filled based on:

Patient’s historical usage of home health, DME, or specialist services

Required features:

One-click referral generation

Integration with preferred provider directories

C. Refill Request Workflow
Implement full support for structured refill request workflows, including:

Auto-filled medication data from patient history

Review interface for approval or modification

Submission via eFax or connected EHR systems

🔒 Compliance & Production Readiness
All actions must adhere to HIPAA and clinical documentation standards.

Ensure full audit logging, data persistence, and role-based access controls are in place.

Perform QA testing across user types (e.g., Doctor, Nurse, Admin) in a mirrored production environment.
